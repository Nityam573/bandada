## Add members

To add members, click on `Add member`.

Depending on the group type, you will be presented with different methods to add members.
- `Off-chain` groups with `Manual` credential and `On-chain` groups:
    - Add members by pasting one or more member IDs, separated by commas, spaces, or newlines, into the `Add member IDs` field.
    - Click on the `Generate new link` button to generate an invite link. Then, copy the invite link and send it with the person you want to invite.
        - Upon visiting the invite link generated by `Generate new link`, click on `Join group` to join the group.
        - The invite link will be invalidated once the user successfully joins the group.

        - Upon visiting the invite link, click on `Join group` to join the group.
